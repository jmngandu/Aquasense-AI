### Problem Being Addressed<br>
Africa faces significant challenges with improper waste disposal and water shortages. Improper waste disposal in Nigeria has led to health concerns such as increased cases of diarrhea, particularly in cities like Odukpani and Akamkpa. This also contributes to environmental degradation and biodiversity loss as animals ingest plastics. In Giyani, South Africa, severe water shortages force residents to travel long distances to collect water from shared sources with animals, exacerbated by delays and budget overruns in water infrastructure projects like the Giyani Water Project.<br>
### Structure<br>
This repository is structured as follows:<br>
- `backend/`: This directory contains the backend code of the Aquasense AI, including the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the Flask framework.<br>
- `frontend/`: Here, you will find the frontend code for the Aquasense AI, implemented using JavaScript, React, and Redux. This directory also includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.<br>
- `models/`: This directory contains the trained Generative AI models used by Aquasense AI to enhance the platform's capabilities. The models are implemented using Python-based AI/ML libraries, and they play a crucial role in solving specific problems such as visual question answering (VQA).<br>
- `bot/`: This directory contains the source code for the telegram bot to make it usable from within telegram groups or chat with the telegram bot.<br>

### Proposed Solution <br>
Aquasense AI proposes a unified system utilizing AI, IoT sensors, and machine learning to address these challenges:
<br>
Waste Detection: Utilizing AI and object detection technology, the system allows users to photograph areas with improper waste disposal. Geolocation data is then sent to waste management companies for prompt action, including clean-up and legal measures against illegal dumping.
<br>
Water Shortage Detection: IoT sensors installed at wells and taps monitor real-time water flow and quality. Machine learning algorithms analyze data to detect anomalies such as dry wells or broken taps, enabling quick response and optimization of water distribution.
<br>
### Alternatives to the Proposed Solution <br>
Waste Management: Current manual inspection methods are limited in scope and effectiveness, particularly evident in cities like Blantyre, Malawi.<br>
Water Shortage: Alternatives include purchasing water from supermarkets or relying on unreliable government water trucks, which are inadequate solutions.<br>
