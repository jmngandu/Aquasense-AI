Problem Being Addressed
Africa faces significant challenges with improper waste disposal and water shortages. Improper waste disposal in Nigeria has led to health concerns such as increased cases of diarrhea, particularly in cities like Odukpani and Akamkpa. This also contributes to environmental degradation and biodiversity loss as animals ingest plastics. In Giyani, South Africa, severe water shortages force residents to travel long distances to collect water from shared sources with animals, exacerbated by delays and budget overruns in water infrastructure projects like the Giyani Water Project.

Proposed Solution
Aquasense AI proposes a unified system utilizing AI, IoT sensors, and machine learning to address these challenges:

Waste Detection: Utilizing AI and object detection technology, the system allows users to photograph areas with improper waste disposal. Geolocation data is then sent to waste management companies for prompt action, including clean-up and legal measures against illegal dumping.

Water Shortage Detection: IoT sensors installed at wells and taps monitor real-time water flow and quality. Machine learning algorithms analyze data to detect anomalies such as dry wells or broken taps, enabling quick response and optimization of water distribution.

Alternatives to the Proposed Solution
Waste Management: Current manual inspection methods are limited in scope and effectiveness, particularly evident in cities like Blantyre, Malawi.
Water Shortage: Alternatives include purchasing water from supermarkets or relying on unreliable government water trucks, which are inadequate solutions.
